# Icon Dump

This small sketch plugin allows a user to export all of the art-boards in a sketch file as an SVG to a directory of their choosing. These art-boards generally contain an isolated icon.

### Downloading and Installing:

1. [Download](https://github.com/kevinokerlund/icon-dump/archive/master.zip) the Icon Dump Sketch plugin directly from GitHub
2. Unzip the archive file
2. Open the folder and `double-click` "icon-dump.sketchplugin" to install the plugin into sketch

### Exporting Icons:
Once you have your sketch file with all your icons open, you can perform the following to export all of the icons from the sketch file into a directory of your choosing:

1. Select `Plugins -> Icon Dump -> Dev Utilities -> Export Icons` from the sketch menu bar
2. From the finder window that is now open, choose the folder you wish to export your icons to
3. Choose "Export to Folder"

> **_Note:_** _Each icon is exported every time this plugin is ran, not just the most recently updated ones. Also, if a file is found matching the exported file, it will override the existing one._

> **_Helpful Hint:_** Export to a build folder in your main process.
